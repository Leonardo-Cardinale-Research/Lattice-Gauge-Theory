This is a repository containing all of my raw code from an internship at Inria Paris in 2023. These files essentially involve Monte Carlo/MCMC simulations of systems on a lattice, namely Ising and lattice gauge theory. Gauge groups include SU(N) (Yang-Mills) and ZN.

Note: This is raw code which isn't particularly presentable and user-friendly at the moment, mainly uploaded for archiving purposes. I might get around to cleaning this up sometime!
